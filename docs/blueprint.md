## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Teal (#008080) evokes feelings of clear communication.
- Background color: Light beige (#F5F5DC), a desaturated version of the primary color, creates a calm working environment.
- Accent color: Salmon (#FA8072) can call the user's attention to controls, links and highlighted keywords. It is an analogous hue to teal that stands out via increased saturation.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif, providing a modern, machined, neutral look, appropriate for both headlines and body text.
- Use minimalist icons for transcription controls (play, pause, stop, upload) and file management (save, export, delete).
- Design a clean and intuitive layout with a prominent display area for the transcript and easily accessible controls.
- Incorporate subtle animations to provide feedback during transcription and loading states.
